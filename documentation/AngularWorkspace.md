# Angular Workspace

Creating an Angular workspace is a recommended practice when working with Angular projects, especially if you plan to build more than one application or library. Let me explain why it's done and how it fits into the process:

## **What is an Angular Workspace?**

An Angular workspace is a directory that contains multiple Angular projects. It can house:

- One or more **applications** (like a web app or a mobile app).
- One or more **libraries** (reusable pieces of code that can be shared across applications).

### **Why Create an Angular Workspace?**

1. **Organized Structure**: A workspace provides a structured environment to manage multiple projects in a single repository. For example, you can have a primary application and multiple libraries (like UI components, utilities, etc.) within the same workspace.

2. **Code Sharing**: When you create libraries within a workspace, you can easily share and reuse code between different applications. This promotes code reusability and helps maintain consistency.

3. **Efficient Builds**: Workspaces allow Angular CLI to optimize the build process by sharing build resources across projects, which can reduce build times.

4. **Modular Development**: Workspaces support modular development, where you can work on different parts of your application (like the UI library) separately and then integrate them into the main application.

### **How it Fits into the Process:**

When you start a new Angular project that involves more than just a single application, you typically:

1. **Create a workspace**: This sets up a directory structure that can contain multiple projects.
2. **Generate projects**: Within this workspace, you can generate applications and libraries as needed.

For example:

- If you're building a company-wide design system, you might create a workspace with several libraries (like a button library, a form library, etc.) that can be used across multiple applications.
- If you're only building a single application and don’t plan to create any reusable libraries, you might not need to use a workspace.

### **In Summary:**

- **Workspaces** are useful when you plan to manage multiple projects (applications or libraries) under a single roof.
- If you’re working on a simple, single application with no plans for libraries, you can skip creating a workspace and directly create your Angular application.

Since you're new to this, starting with a single application without a workspace is perfectly fine. As you get more comfortable with Angular, you can explore workspaces for larger, more complex projects.
